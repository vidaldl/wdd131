            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                The purpose of this website is to establish my personal brand as a competent Junior Fullstack Web Developer. 
                It will serve as a digital portfolio to showcase my technical proficiency in JavaScript, Python, and PHP, 
                demonstrating my ability to build responsive and dynamic web applications.
            </p>

            <h3>Audience</h3>
            <p>
                My primary audience consists of hiring managers, technical recruiters, and senior developers at tech companies 
                who are looking to hire a Junior Fullstack Developer. They value clean code, modern design, and clear 
                communication of technical skills.
            </p>

            <h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
            <p>
                I will demonstrate my JavaScript mastery by building an interactive "Skills Tracker" on the child page.
                <br><br>
                1. <strong>Objects & Arrays:</strong> I will store my skills (JS, Python, PHP) and proficiency levels in an <code>Array of Objects</code>.
                <br>
                2. <strong>ES Modules:</strong> I will store this data in a separate module file and import it into the main script.
                <br>
                3. <strong>Array Methods:</strong> I will use the <code>.map()</code> method to iterate through the array and dynamically generate HTML progress bars for each skill.
                <br>
                4. <strong>DOM & Events:</strong> I will add "View Details" buttons that listen for <code>click</code> events.
                <br>
                5. <strong>Conditionals:</strong> Inside the event listener, I will use conditional branching (if/else) to toggle the visibility of the skill descriptions (expanding or collapsing the card).
            </p>
